## Purpose

Problem: when trying a new recipe, it's often advised to make it multiple times in a row to iron out the kinks so to speak. However, I don't always think this is feasible due to ingredient availability, boredom, picky kids, life etc. I also find that even when I do perfect a recipe, if I come back to it after some time - I don't always remember the exact changes I made to perfect the dish.

Solution: I want to create a website where you can log attempts of making a dish. I want this to also be a platform where people can share their recipes. However, what makes this functionality different is that people can share their own takes on a recipe. I think this is a fun way to share how different people can put their own spin on the same dish. 

## MVP

* CRUD capability creating the recipe
  - ingredients
  - method
  - summary
  - tips

* Collection of your accounts recipes where you can log multiple attempts of this recipe.

* The ability to save someone elses recipe and save it to your collection of recipes which is then able to be edited, logged and re-shared.
  - this will always show where the original recipe came from
  
* Recipe viewing dashboard
* Accounts, admin and personal
  - ability to make ones own account
* Hosted on AWS using Docker

## Research Needed

* Accounts and Security
* Planning out the code

## Technology
* TSX, Redux, AWS, mySQL, Java (SB)
